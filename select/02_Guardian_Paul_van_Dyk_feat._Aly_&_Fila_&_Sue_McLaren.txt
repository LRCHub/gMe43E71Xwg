Shadows surround you
Where's the smile I long to see back on your face
What am I to do
In the end I only want to know you're safe
So precious to lose
Impossible to hold when you are worlds away
A thousand thoughts of you
Who'll protect you when the thunder rains
Maybe they'll keep eye on earth
Promise you'll never will be hurt
Maybe they'll keep eye on earth
Promise you'll never will be hurt
Shadows surround you
In the end I only want to know you're safe
Maybe they'll keep eye on earth
Promise you'll never will be hurt
