In all my silence I could hear her
I was compelled to write it down
Astonished by the things she told me
Revealing all she had to say
Chorus:
I'm your guardian angel
Longing to hear my name
And I've been with you for ages
Open breathe me in
She says I'll grant you all your wishes
And sprinkle candy in your dreams
Chorus
I'm your guardian angel
Only a prayer away
And I'll shelter you from darkness
Open and breathe me in
