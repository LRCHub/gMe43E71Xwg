I'm the messenger of the Beast,
I'm the legate I mediate,
The demon, the holy light of summer,
The planetary ghost,
The seal of Salomon, Holy Guardian,
The number of the sun.

Whorship me with blood and with fire,
Adore me with your sword.
Enjoy yourself with all things that come
From sex and ecstasy.

I'm the union of all mankind.
I'm the Higher Spiritual Beings,
The only that can master the forces
Of all this lower world,
The projection of your perfect self,
The prince you can awake.

Whorship me with blood and with fire,
Adore me with your sword.
Enjoy yourself with all things that come
From sex and ecstasy.

I'm your Angel! The Guardian Angel!
I'm your Angel! The Guardian Angel!

Whorship me with blood and with fire,
Adore me with your sword.
Enjoy yourself with all things that come
From sex and ecstasy.

I'm your Angel! The Guardian Angel!
I'm your Angel! The Guardian Angel!
