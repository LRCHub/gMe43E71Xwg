# Poppy – Guardian

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Ephemeral or eternal,
where is the divide?
They try to hold you 'til
you spiral down
They circle, unravel
Trying to devise a plan to
drain you to your peril
Then cast you back to the
hell I used to know
When all the gods lose faith,
the cities laid to waste
I will be there,
I'll be your guardian
You're in my every breath,
I'll give you all that
I have left
But I'll be there,
I'll be your guardian
Liars hang in shallow,
hiding from the light
And all the cowards count
the hours down
There's crimson on the arrows
The modest dress in white,
and all the villains
Taunt in whispers,
remind you of a hell you
used to know
When all the gods lose faith,
the cities laid to waste
I will be there,
I'll be your guardian
You're in my every breath,
I'll give you all that
I have left
But I'll be there,
I'll be your guardian
So keep your panicked eyes on me
'Cause this time we have is
all we need to fight eternally
Eternally
Oh-oh,
when all the gods lose faith,
the cities laid to waste
I will be there,
I'll be your guardian
You're in my every breath,
I'll give you all that
I have left
And I'll be the one,
I won't leave you now
When all the gods lose faith,
the cities laid to waste
I will be there,
I'll be your guardian
(Tonight)
You're in my every breath,
I'll give you all that
I have left
But I'll be there,
I'll be your guardian
Through the wreck,
we leave it behind
I'll be your guardian
